# stressaddition
This is the R implementation of the tri-phasic concentration-response model introduced in
[Liess, M., Henz, S. & Knillmann, S. Predicting low-concentration effects of pesticides. Sci Rep 9, 15248 (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-51645-4). It allows modeling of ecotoxicological experiments where the response shows signs of a hormesis effect.

The EC<sub>x-SyS</sub> and Multi-TOX models from this package are also available as part of the [Indicate app](http://www.systemecology.eu/indicate) which offers a graphical user interface.

## Installation
Stressaddition is not yet on CRAN. You can install the most recent stable version from GitLab using the remotes package:
``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_gitlab("oekotox/stressaddition", host = "git.ufz.de")
```
Alternatively there are binary and source builds of various versions downloadable from the [releases page](https://git.ufz.de/oekotox/stressaddition/-/releases).

## Updating
RStudio's integrated package updater won't detect updates in packages installed from GitHub or GitLab. I recommend running 
```r
remotes::update_packages()
```
in regular intervals to check for updates from those sources.

## Citation
Please cite this package if you use it in your analysis. See `citation("stressaddition")` for details.

## Example
```r
library(stressaddition)
model <- ecxsys(
    concentration = c(0, 0.05, 0.5, 5, 30),
    hormesis_concentration = 0.5,
    survival_tox_observed = c(90, 81, 92, 28, 0),
    survival_tox_env_observed = c(29, 27, 33, 5, 0)
)

# Plot the effect and the system stress:
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
plot_survival(model)
plot_stress(model)

# The LC50 under the influence of toxicant and system tress:
lc(model, "survival_tox_sys", 50)

# The LC10 under the influence  of toxicant, system and environmental tress:
lc(model, "survival_tox_env_sys", 10)
```
