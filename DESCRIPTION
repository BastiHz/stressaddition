Description: The stress addition approach is an alternative to the traditional 
    concentration addition or effect addition models. It allows the modelling 
    of tri-phasic concentration-response relationships either as single toxicant 
    experiments, in combination with an environmental stressor or as mixtures of 
    two toxicants.
