\title{stressaddition: Modeling Tri-Phasic Concentration-Response Relationships}
\description{
The implementation of the tri-phasic concentration-response model 
    introduced in "Predicting low-concentration effects of pesticides" by 
    Liess, Henz and Knillmann (2019) <doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-51645-4>. It 
    allows modeling of ecotoxicological experiments where the response shows 
    signs of a hormesis effect.
}
\details{
See the publication linked below for more information including
  equations.

  In the paper the model is introduced in the context of survival
  experiments. However, it can also be used to model other concentration
  dependent responses. For this reason the more general term "effect" instead
  of "survival" is used throughout the package.
