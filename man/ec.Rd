\title{Effect Concentrations}
\usage{
ec(model, response_name, response_level)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{This can be one of three types of objects: Either the output of
\code{\link{ecxsys}} or the output of \code{\link{predict_ecxsys}} or a
data frame with a "concentration" column and a \code{response_name} column.
See the examples.}

\item{response_name}{The name of the effect or stress for which you want to
calculate the EC. Must be one of \code{colnames(model$curves)}.}

\item{response_level}{The desired response level as a percentage between 0
and 100. For example with the value 10 the function will return the EC10,
i.e. the concentration where the response falls below 90 \% of the maximum
response.}
}
\value{
A list containing the response concentration and the corresponding
  response value.
}
\description{
Estimate the concentration to reach a certain effect or stress level relative
to the control.
}
\details{
If the response level occurs multiple times because of hormesis, which may
happen for low values of \code{response_level}, then the occurrence with the
smallest concentration is returned.
}
\examples{
# Calculate the EC_10, the concentration where the effect falls
# below 90 \% of the effect in the control.

model <- ecxsys(
    concentration = c(0, 0.05, 0.5, 5, 30),
    hormesis_concentration = 0.5,
    effect_tox_observed = c(90, 81, 92, 28, 0)
)

# using the ecxsys() output or the curves therein directly:
ec(model, "effect_tox_sys", 10)
ec(model$curves, "effect_tox_sys", 10)

# using the output of predict_ecxsys() with custom concentrations:
conc <- 10^seq(-9, 1, length.out = 1000)
curves <- predict_ecxsys(model, conc)
ec(curves, "effect_tox_sys", 10)

# using a custom data frame:
df_custom <- data.frame(
    concentration = curves$concentration,
    foo = curves$effect_tox_sys
)
ec(df_custom, "foo", 10)

}
