# Using the rocker/tidyverse image because it has devtools and testthat.

# Using "document = FALSE" catches potential mismatches between the roxygen
# comments and the .Rd files. This could happen when checking locally
# with "document = TRUE" (the default), which updates the .Rd files, but then
# forgetting to commit and push those updated .Rd files.

# Setting the environment variable "_R_CHECK_SYSTEM_CLOCK_" to 0
# to disable package time check, see issue #54

# Run the R commands under a single "R -e" so everything runs in
# the same R session.
# Note for the future: If there are going to be more R commands just put them
# in a separate R script and run that from here.
