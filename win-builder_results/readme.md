Run `devtools::check_win_devel()` to check in the development version of R under windows. The results will be e-mailed to the address of the maintainer. In some cases it can take almost a day, so be patient. Then save 00check.log and 00install.out in this directory.


This note here can be ignored:
```
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Sebastian Henz <sebastian.henz@ufz.de>'
```
It just tells CRAN that it should only accept submissions from the maintainer's e-mail address. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23829978/checking-cran-incoming-feasibility-note-maintainer
